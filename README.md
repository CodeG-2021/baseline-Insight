Baseline Insight is a complete developer tool designed to help web teams analyze their projects and understand how modern features align with the official Baseline standard.

Modern web development often faces the challenge of knowing whether a new API, CSS property, or HTML feature is ready for production use across all major browsers. Developers usually need to search through scattered resources like MDN, Can I Use, or release notes, which takes time and creates uncertainty.

Baseline Insight solves this problem by scanning your project files (HTML, CSS, and JS/TS) and automatically detecting which features are:

✅ Widely available — safe to use everywhere.

🟡 Newly available — supported but still recent.

🔴 Limited availability — not yet fully interoperable.

🔍 What it offers

A visual dashboard with a global compatibility score, file-by-file analysis, and traffic-light status for each feature.

Actionable recommendations such as polyfills, progressive enhancement tips, and direct links to MDN documentation.

Report exporting in PDF, Markdown, or JSON for audits, reviews, or sharing with teammates.

CI/CD integration through a CLI tool and GitHub Actions, enabling automated checks on every pull request.

An educational mode with tooltips and quizzes that helps developers learn compatibility best practices.
